# Voron-V0.1-Magnet_Panel_Mount
converts the current voron v0.1 panel mounting parts into easily removeable magnetic mounts.
Perfect for switching between abs/pla without the hassle of unscrewing everytime.

Mounts using the basic m3x8 hardware that the original parts mounted with.

Included are the fles for a spacer to fill the gap between the frame and the panels to help with heat loss, this is not needed but will help. 
I have installed some 12mmx6mm adhesive draft excluder found easily on amazon.
You will need to print 8 of each "part 1" and "part 2" to fit each side, they will not totally fill the gap, 
there is a small space left on the top and bottom to allow gripping the panel to remove it.


required hardware:

16x m3x8 (orginal hardware)

16x m3 nut (original hardware)

16x 8mmx2mm neodymium magnets (You can source easy enough, but here is a link to the ones i have used from UK Amazon; https://www.amazon.co.uk/Magnet-Expert%C2%AE-8mm-thick-Neodymium/dp/B007JTL25M/ref=sr_1_2?crid=VG4LDUUBDICR&keywords=8mmx2mm+magnet&qid=1647471673&sprefix=8mmx2mm+magnet%2Caps%2C48&sr=8-2 )


Optional hardware:
